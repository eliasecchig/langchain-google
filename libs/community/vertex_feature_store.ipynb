    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook guides you through building a low-latency vector search system for your GenAI application using Vertex AI Feature Store. We'll leverage the [Vertex Feature Store Langchain integration]([link to integration]) to streamline this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Store seamlessly integrates with BigQuery, providing a unified data storage and flexible vector search options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BigQuery Vector Search**: Ideal for batch retrieval and prototyping, as it requires no infrastructure setup.\n",
    "- **Feature Store Online Store**: Enables low-latency retrieval with manual or scheduled data sync. Perfect for production-ready user-facing GenAI applications.\n",
